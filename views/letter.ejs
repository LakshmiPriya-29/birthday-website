<div class="letter">
  <p>
    Dear Love,<br><br>
    From the moment we met, youâ€™ve brought nothing but joy and sunshine into my life. On your birthday, I want to remind you how truly special you are to me. ðŸ’–<br><br>
    You are the reason I smile, the reason I feel strong, and the reason I feel loved every single day.<br><br>
    I made this small website just to say... I love you â€” today, tomorrow, and always. ðŸ’ž<br><br>
    Yours forever,<br>
    <strong>â€“ Lakshmi Priya ðŸ’•</strong>
